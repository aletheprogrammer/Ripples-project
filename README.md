# Ripples-project
A p5.js project that creates ripples when mouse clicked on canvas. My first project on GH 

V2 works as it's intended but the code is too simple and limited. 
V3 is an improvement but encountered some issues: using for..loop and setTimeout to replicate the same effect as in V2 partially works but Ripple(x, y) values gets mixed up in mousePressed when one object is created(clicked) before the other completes its cycle. 
It also seems to affect r++, it doubles its speed randomly

This project open to anyone who wants play and to try improv it, happy coding!
